Basic DEVS Model Layer Examples

The Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) basic model layer is provided. Download the uploaded zip file and run any of the examples in the Models.java package. 

There are added examples in this project with extended SES models. 

If you are interested in the code for the DEVS Markov and SES capabilities, please reference the forks from the DEVS-Markov and DEVS-Markov-SES.
